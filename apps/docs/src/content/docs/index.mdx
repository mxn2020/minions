## Why Minions?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Three Simple Primitives" icon="pencil">
    Everything is built from **Minions** (instances), **MinionTypes** (schemas), and **Relations** (typed links).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Complexity" icon="add-document">
    Start with a single flat agent. Grow into nested structures with memory, skills, and teams — no migration needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schema-Driven Validation" icon="approve-check">
    Every field is validated against its type schema. No more guessing what shape your agent data is in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Framework Agnostic" icon="setting">
    Works with any storage backend, any runtime, any AI framework. Pure TypeScript, zero opinions about infrastructure.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
