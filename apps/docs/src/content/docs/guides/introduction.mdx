## What is Minions?

**Minions** is a universal structured object system for AI agents. It provides a small, powerful set of primitives — **Minions** (instances), **MinionTypes** (schemas), and **Relations** (typed links) — that let you model, validate, persist, and evolve any kind of structured data.

Think of it as a schema-driven object graph: every piece of data has a known type, every field is validated, every connection is explicit, and the whole structure can evolve over time without breaking existing data.

## Who is it for?

- **AI engineers** building agent systems that need structured memory, tool definitions, or prompt storage
- **Full-stack developers** who want typed, validated objects without a database schema migration tool
- **Tool builders** creating CLIs, dashboards, or APIs that manage structured entities

## Core Design Principles

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Three Primitives" icon="pencil">
    Everything is a **Minion** (instance), typed by a **MinionType** (schema), connected via **Relations** (typed links). No more, no less.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Complexity" icon="add-document">
    Start flat. Add relations when you need hierarchy. Add storage when you need persistence. The SDK never forces structure you don't need yet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schema-Driven Validation" icon="approve-check">
    Every field is validated at creation and update time. 12 field types (string, number, date, url, enum, json, etc.) with configurable constraints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Framework Agnostic" icon="setting">
    Zero dependencies. Works in Node.js, Deno, Bun, browsers, and Python 3.11+. Bring your own storage, your own runtime, your own AI framework.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Ecosystem

Minions is the core SDK. The broader ecosystem includes:
