title: Bundles vs Toolboxes
description: Learn the difference between Minions toolboxes (for active agents) and bundles (for domain-specific data definitions).
---

The Minions ecosystem provides two ways to consume and extend the Minions platform: **Toolboxes** and **Bundles**. 

Both are structured as full monorepos that provide a unified developer experience containing a core TypeScript library, a Python bindings package, a CLI, and interactive frontends (Docs, Web app, Blog).

## What are Toolboxes?

**Toolboxes** contain *active* components:
- **Agents**: Configured AI identities ready to execute logic.
- **Skills**: Functions, tools, and capabilities that agents can use to perform actions.

Toolboxes are designed to give agents the "verbs" they need to interact with external systems (e.g., `minions-tasks` provides project management skills, `minions-prompts` provides prompt-generation skills).

## What are Bundles?

**Bundles** contain *passive* components (data definitions):
- **MinionTypes**: JSON schemas and typescript interfaces defining the shape of your data.
- **Relations**: Definitions of how different MinionTypes connect to one another.
- **Views**: Configurations for how this data should be displayed in user interfaces.

Bundles provide the "nouns" of your system. For example, `minions-bundles-crm` defines types like `Lead`, `Deal`, and `Interaction`. 

### Defining a Bundle

Bundles are generated automatically using the `create-minions-bundle` scaffolder. You simply define your domain models in a declarative `TOML` configuration file, and the scaffolder builds a robust, cross-language monorepo:

\`\`\`toml
[bundle]
name = "minions-bundles-crm"
description = "CRM pipeline bundle"

[[types]]
id = "bundle-crm-lead"
name = "Lead"
slug = "lead"
icon = "👤"
description = "A potential customer"

[[types.fields]]
name = "source"
type = "string"
\`\`\`

Running the scaffolder (`create-minions-bundle crm.toml`) automatically generates the monorepo with cross-language SDKs, a CLI tool to manage your resources, and ready-to-deploy interactive documentation sites mapping straight to your domain models.
