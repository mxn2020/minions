Today we are excited to announce a massive enhancement to the Minions ecosystem: **Minions Bundles**.

If you've been using Minions, you are likely familiar with **Toolboxes** (like `minions-tasks` and `minions-prompts`) which provide active logic, agents, and skills to execute workflows. A key gap, however, has been how to structure the *data* that these agents operate on.

## The Nouns of your Business

Bundles are designed to be the "nouns" of your application. While a toolbox gives your agent the *skill* to "Update a Lead", a **Bundle** defines what a `Lead` actually is. 

Bundles are comprised of:
- **MinionTypes**: The definitive JSON Schemas specifying what shape of data your objects have.
- **Relations**: Structured links between different types (e.g. A `Deal` belongs to a `Lead`).
- **Views**: Configurations determining how these objects are visualized in user interfaces.

## Scaffolding a Bundle Monorepo

We've shipped a brand new CLI, `create-minions-bundle`, designed to make curating a bundle completely frictionless.

You write a simple, declarative `TOML` file:

\`\`\`toml
[bundle]
name = "minions-bundles-crm"
description = "CRM pipeline bundle — leads, deals, interactions"

[[types]]
id = "bundle-crm-lead"
name = "Lead"
slug = "lead"
icon = "👤"
description = "A potential customer"

[[types.fields]]
name = "source"
type = "string"
\`\`\`

And the scaffolder takes care of the rest! By running `npx create-minions-bundle crm.toml`, it generates a beautiful, heavily-configured `pnpm` workspace featuring:
- A `packages/core` TypeScript library exposing the SDK for node environments.
- A `packages/python` Poetry library exposing the exact same types for Python data science workflows.
- A `packages/cli` command line utility to interact with your specific data models.
- Three web applications (`apps/docs`, `apps/web`, `apps/blog`) to help you document and showcase your bundle internally or to the world.

## The Future of AI Integration

By separating the execution logic (Toolboxes) from the data models (Bundles), Minions enables incredible composability. You can install the official `minions-bundles-crm` to get standard CRM types, and pair it with your own proprietary Toolboxes to orchestrate sales workflows completely autonomously.
